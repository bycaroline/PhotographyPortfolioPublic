                <p>As a photographer I revel in working with a creative point of view through my lense, capturing moments to be remembered by my clients. <br />
                    <br />
                    I seek to tell the story behind each moment, smile, face and artifact that I have the opportunity to capture. When it comes to real estate photography my aim is to highlight each propertyâ€™s key traits and attributes, while enticing the viewer to feel transferred and picturing themselves there.
